- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FerroFrancisco
- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in learning programming to develop my own applications and scripts for civil engineering, hydrological and hydraulic modeling, and BIM modeling. I would also like to delve deeper into data analysis programming to apply it to project management, and web programming out of personal curiosity.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, UX/UI and Power BI. 
- ðŸ“« You can contact me at my professional email fferro@effeingenieria.com.
- ðŸ˜„ And call me Fran
